# Memory Matching Game
## ** Created by Jonathan Deleon **

### How to use/play
This game is my take on a digital matching game within a computer oriented styling.

1. Enter your player name
2. Press 'Start New Game'
3. Click on pairs and attempt to obtain a match (same card on each click)
4. Keep matching and racing against the clock and score!

** Multiple players can play within same game session by entering different player names before a game completes. **


### Dependencies
* Font Awesome SVG images
* animation.css open source css animations
* Google Fonts - Orbitron

### Game Logic
##### Star Ratings:
* You lose a star every 10 moves you make (max 30 moves and you're at 0 stars).

##### Score
* Each turn you take (a pair of cards selected) your score will increase by 1, including successful and unsuccessful match attempts.

##### Time
* Time will begin immediately on the click of "Start New Game".
* This time is incremented by 1 second intervals.

### Future Updates To Do
1. A motion (space) background.
2. Ability for user to select a style / theme they would like to play the game with.
3. KeyStroke controller for selecting and matching cards (including hover over animations using keyboard input)
